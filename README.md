Testing out Sass
(requires: node.js, and npm packages: node-sass, watch)


With this package I can convert my Sass files to CSS files. 


I start by running `npm run watch:sass`. 

Then I edit a sass file (in the scss folder), and save. 

The script scans through my SCSS directory, and adds any changes to my CSS folder.
