Convert Sass files to CSS

(**requires**: `node.js`, and npm packages: `node-sass`, `watch`)


With this package I can automatically convert my Sass files to CSS files. 


I start by running `npm run watch:sass`. 
Then I edit a sass file (in the SCSS folder), and save. 
The script scans through my SCSS directory, and adds any changes to my CSS folder.
